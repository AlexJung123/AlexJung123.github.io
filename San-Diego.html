          <p class="white-text descriptionText1">
          <em> San Diego is a beautiful city at the Californian coast.
            I spend four months studying in San Diego from september to december and appreciated the time there a lot.
          You will have good weather even in the fall season what allows you to go out and explore the city and the beaches.
          I can really recommend to go there during the last quarter of the year to enjoy the christmas time.</em>

          Coronado Beach is next to the Hotel del Coronado and has a wide space of white sand and broad access to the pacific ocean.
          Mission Beach is a bit smaller than Coronado Beach but much longer and gives the opportunity for a walk on the sand or promenade.</p>

        <p class="white-text"> San Diego is a paradise for surfers. It provides a combination of warm weather and high waves. I started surfing there more spontaneous than prepared.
           You can go to one of the several surfshops near the beach and rent a board and a swimsuit for affordable prices.
         Don't be scared of trying it, even I, as a beginner, was able to stand up on the board once or twice. A special advise: In the christmas time you can do ice skating directly at colorado beach.</p>

          There is a great atmosphere created by the hugh amounts of fans supporting their team. Another sport you should follow on at all cost is the american basketball league.
          Take the bus or car to Los Angeles and watch a game of the LA Lakers. The tickets are definitly worth the price. </p>
